* Space colonization algorithm
* Diffusion-limited aggregation
* Eden growth model
* Perlin noise
* Reaction-diffusion
* Vertex dynamics
* L-systems
* Flow aggregation
* Cell differentiation

## Goal
Combine existing models and experiment to create a faithful representation of biofilm development.

## Future goals
Model development of other interesting biological systems.
